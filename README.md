# üíæ Vercel MCP Server for Zed

This extension acts as a remote client for a [Vercel MCP](https://vercel.com/docs/mcp) server, allowing you to use it as a context server for [Zed's](https://zed.dev) [Agent Panel.](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/overview)

It uses the `mcp-remote` tool to create a local stdio proxy to your remote, HTTP-based Vercel MCP server, enabling seamless integration with the Zed editor.

## ü§ñ Overview

Instead of running a local MCP server, this extension connects to a server you have deployed on Vercel. This allows you to leverage powerful, cloud-based tools within Zed's AI assistant.

### üíæ Installation

**1. Prerequisites**

Before using this extension, you must have a Vercel MCP server deployed and accessible via a public URL. You can learn how to create one by following the [official Vercel MCP documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/mcp).

**2. Install from Zed Marketplace**

- **Open**: Open the Command Palette in Zed (`cmd-shift-p`).
- **Type**: Type `zed: extensions`.
- **Search**: Search for "Vercel MCP Server" and install it directly from the extension marketplace.

**3. Configuration**

- **Open**: Open your Zed `settings.json` file.
- **Add**: Configure the URL of your deployed Vercel MCP server:

```json
"context_servers": {
  "mcp-server-vercel": {
    "settings": {
      "url": "<YOUR_VERCEL_MCP_SERVER_URL>"
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `<YOUR_VERCEL_MCP_SERVER_URL>` with the actual URL of your server (e.g., `https://my-mcp-server.vercel.app/api/mcp`).
