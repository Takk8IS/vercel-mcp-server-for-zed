# üíæ AWS MCP Server for Zed

This extension provides an AWS Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for the Zed editor, allowing you to use AWS services as a context provider for Zed's AI Assistant.

It enables Zed to communicate with AWS services, such as retrieving information from S3, querying DynamoDB, or invoking Lambda functions, directly within the editor's context.

## ü§ñ Overview

This extension starts a local MCP server that is configured to interact with your AWS account. By providing your AWS credentials, the server can access your AWS resources and provide relevant information to Zed's AI assistant.
